Create a custom tag <ct:currentDateTime>that accepts two attributes (color and size) that prints the current date and time.

Example:
JSP:  <ct:currentDateTime color="red" size="12px" />
HTML: <span style="color: red; font-size: 12px;">Mon 2016.04.04 at 04:14:09 PM PDT</span>

You may use the following code snippet:
Date dNow = new Date();
SimpleDateFormat ft = new SimpleDateFormat ("E yyyy.MM.dd 'at' hh:mm:ss a zzz");
System.out.println("Current Date: " + ft.format(dNow));

Please submit your lab by writing your report here, and then either linking to your code on github, or including it as a zip file.
